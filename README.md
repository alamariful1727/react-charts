# How to use charts in React [Typescript]

## First Package : Chart.js

### `yarn add react-chartjs-2 chart.js`

## Second Package : Echarts

### `yarn add echarts echarts-for-react`

[Options](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#title)
[Examples](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html)

# Which is best ?

## I have used both for my application. I'll recommend you to use [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html). From my point of view, it's documentation is so good and the online editor makes my learning curve smooth which can help you to customized the chart.
